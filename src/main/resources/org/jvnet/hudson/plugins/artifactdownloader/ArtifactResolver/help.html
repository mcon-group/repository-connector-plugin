<div>
    <p>
        Define the artifacts you would like to download.<br />
        The target directory defines where the artifacts should be copied to.
        The coordinates are as you know it from maven or ivy:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>GroupId: This is generally unique amongst an organization or a project.</li>
        <li>ArtifactId: The artifactId is generally the name that the project is known by.</li>
        <li>Version: The version of the artifact to be resolved. The dynamic definitions 'RELEASE' (the latest release) and 'LATEST' (the latest build) are allowed too.</li>
        <li>Classifier: It is some optional and arbitrary string that - if present - is appended to the artifact name just after the version number.</li>
        <li>Extension: This is the extension of the artifact to be resolved. Important: this is not always the same as 'packaging' in maven! (although it might be the same e.g. for 'jar')</li>
        <li>Target file name: should the file have a different name after downloading? You can also define a subdirectory.</li>
    </ul>
